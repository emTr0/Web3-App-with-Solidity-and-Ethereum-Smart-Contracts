# Build a Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts

Based on a [BuildSpace](https://buildspace.so/) project where I learned some Solidity, wrote and deployed a smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain (Rinkeby testnet), and built a Web3 client app to interact with my contract.

Web3 client app available at [waveportal-starter-project.emtr0.repl.co](https://waveportal-starter-project.emtr0.repl.co/).
